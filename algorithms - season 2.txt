Write an algorithm to make eba
- light your stove
 - check kerosene, wool etc
	- open kerosene tank/reservoir
	- is kerosene below 1 cl
		- yes, top kerosene
 - if needed, top kerosene/replace wool etc
 - light matches
 - light wool
- place the pot on the stove
- put the water in the pot
- boil for 15 minutes
- add the garri
- turn/stir till ready


Write an algorithm to add 2 numbers
- Supply the first number and store in A
- Supply the second number and store in B
- Add A and B and store in C
- Display C

Add (A, B) 
C = Add (2,3) 

Exchange the content of 2 containers
- Let the containers be A and B
- Put contents in A and B
- Let a 3rd be C
- Put A in C
- Put B in A
- Put C in B

Find the maximum of a list of numbers
- Supply the list numbers L -  L1, L2, L3, L4,.... Ln
- Let L1 be the MAX
- from L2 to LN
	- Let current number be Li
	- if Li > MAX, MAX = Li
- Display MAX/MAX is the maximum number

23 4 7 14 34 12

Determine if a number is prime.
- Supply the number as N
- Let the number be Prime
- from 2 to N/2
	Let current number be i
	If N MOD i = 0 //does the current number perfectly divide N?
		Number is NOT Prime
		STOP looping
Display Result
	
N = 13
13 is prime
N/2 = 6
from 2 to 6
	i = 2; 
	13 MOD 2 = 1
	
	i = 3;
	13 MOD 3 = 1
	
	i = 4; 
	13 MOD 4 = 1
	
	i = 5;
	13 MOD 5 = 3
	
	i = 6;
	13 MOD 6 = 1
	
13 is prime

N = 15
15 is prime
N/2 = 7
from 2 to 7
	i = 2;
	15 mod 2 = 1
	
	i = 3;
	15 mod 3 = 0;
	
15 is NOT prime

Calculate Average of a set of numbers
- Supply the numbers as X1, X2... Xn
- Add all the numbers
	- Let the sum be S
	- Set S = 0
	- from i=1 to n // go from X1 to Xn
		Add  Xi to S
- Let the average be A
- A = S/n
- Display A

Calculate area of a triagle

Assignment
1 - Write an algorithm to greet a person based on his/her gender
- Start
- Supply Gender as G
- If G = "Male"
	Display "Good Morning Sir"
  else
	Display "Good Morning Ma"
- End



2 - Write an algorithm to search a list of numbers. The algorithm should display the location/index if found, else it should display NOT FOUND

- Start
- Supply the list of numbers as X1, X2, X3.... Xn (array)
- Supply the item as Y
- from i=1 to n //go from X1 to Xn
	- if (Xi = Y) 
		display "Item found in location i"
		stop looping
		END
	- else continue
- display "Number NOT found"
- End


A = f(x) = x2 + 2x + 3
f(3) = 9 + 6 + 3 = 18
